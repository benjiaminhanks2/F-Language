How to compile F language

Current verson is F44. Below example shows you how to compile F44.exe.
After you can make F44.exe, you can then go on your modifications ...

1. copy entire F44src.exe to F44 
2. F44src.exe is self_extract 
3. make sure your path environment variable setting is ready to go, 
   such as,

   PATH=c:\windows;c:\windows\command;C:\TC;C:\edit;

   Clear all other unnecessary path settings or other environment 
   variables to avoid any unexcepted disturbings. For example, 
   you may have some settings for Visual C ++ or the likes I don't 
   know. Clear them all, we don't need them here.

4. delete all *.obj and forth.exe 
5. run make, 
   
   C:\f\f44\> make > c:\f\errlog.txt
   
   Turbo C 2.0's make.exe reads the defaul data file makefile that I have
   prepared for you in the working directory. Compile, link, and pklite
   compression will be done as simple as this one-step activity.
   
6. Everything done in a very short time. 
   Check the errlog.txt, it should be looked like below. See, only PNP.C
   has 4 warnings. Congratulations, you have made it. You can run forth.exe
   now.

7. Use DOS command FC to compare forth.exe and F42.exe, they are identicle.
8. You can start your own developing now. Just don't forget to modify "F42", "1998"
   and the author's name in below statement in forth.c to a proper new value.

    puts(
            "Chern's F42 interpreter (C) 1995..1998 by H.C. Chen\n"
            "Usage: f42 [<script filename> [word ...]]\n"
            "No macro specified, we're in debug mode.\n"
    );
